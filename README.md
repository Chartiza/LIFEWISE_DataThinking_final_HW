## Project Overview

🏡 The LIFEWISE (Life Index for Well-being and Expense Sustainability) project utilizes regression analysis to identify optimal places to live, considering the balance between well-being and expenses. It aims to provide actionable insights for individuals seeking high-quality living within their budget, while also offering decision-making support for policymakers, urban planners, and real estate developers. The goal of the project is to empower individuals and communities to make informed choices that enhance their overall quality of life and long-term sustainability.
