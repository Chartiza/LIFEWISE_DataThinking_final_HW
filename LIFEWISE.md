**LIFEWISE** _(Life Index for Well-being and Expense Sustainability)_ project utilizes regression analysis to identify optimal places to live, considering the balance between well-being and expenses. It offers actionable insights for individuals seeking high-quality living within their budget, while providing decision-making support for policymakers, urban planners, and real estate developers. The project aims to empower individuals and communities to make informed choices that enhance their overall quality of life and long-term sustainability. 

## The Data

Each service request contains a wealth of information. When a call is made, the data is recorded and categorized by various parameters such as:

- The date the request was created and closed
- The agency responsible
- The type of complaint
- The location of the incident

And much more. All these details provide a comprehensive snapshot of the incident, allowing us to understand the types of issues city dwellers face and how effectively they are resolved.

## Analysis

By examining the 'Complaint Type' field in our data, we can start to see trends emerge. Perhaps we find that noise complaints spike during the summer months, or that a specific borough has a high incidence of pothole reports. This analysis can provide insights that help shape city policy and resource allocation.

## Response Time: A Measure of Efficiency

The 'Created Date' and 'Closed Date' fields can tell us a lot about how responsive the city is to these service requests. By calculating the difference between these dates, we can measure the efficiency of each agency and even identify patterns that might be affecting performance.

## Location, Location, Location

With 'Incident Zip' and 'Borough' fields, we can plot service requests geographically. This visualization can highlight areas with high service demand or places where certain types of complaints are more prevalent. This information is invaluable for city planners and policymakers.

## Wrapping Up

The data from 3-1-1 service requests tells a story that goes beyond mere numbers. It's a narrative about the city's responsiveness, its challenges, and its ongoing journey to improve the lives of its residents. As we continue to analyze this data, we can help create a more responsive and efficient city.
